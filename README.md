# **Heart Attack Analysis with Jupyter Notebook**

## **Introduction**

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of heart attack data using Python. The purpose of this project is to explore, visualize, and analyze a dataset related to heart attacks to gain insights into potential risk factors and predictive factors.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is named "Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction" and can be found at [source link]. It contains various attributes related to heart health, including patient information, medical measurements, and whether or not a heart attack occurred.

## **Requirements**

Before running this Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
